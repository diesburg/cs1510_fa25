<h3>Installing Python/IDLE on your computer</h3>
<p> Python is free to install.  If you have a PC or Mac and the ability to install programs, please install the newest version of Python from <a href="https://python.org">https://python.org</a>.  If you have Linux, come see me for the package names.</p>

<p> If you are renting a PC from UNI, please come see me, because we can often put in a request to get Python/IDLE installed.</p>

<h3>Chromebooks and other situations</h3>
	
<p>Some of you might be relying on a chromebook or a PC without the ability to install programs (like a borrowed or rented laptop).  While not quite as good, you can use an online version of Python and IDLE to develop your programs.  Here is an <a href="https://uni.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=c02de7a6-e6f3-4a0a-ad15-b1e1014c303c">explanation video of how to get started</a>.</p>
	
<p> If you have a chromebook and are comfortable using the command line, you can install Python and IDLE using the underlying Linux operating system.  Here is an <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/article/idle-on-chromebook">article that explains how</a>.</p>
